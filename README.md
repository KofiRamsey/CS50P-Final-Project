#### Description:
The **Advanced Calculator** is a comprehensive and versatile application designed to handle a wide array of mathematical operations, making it an indispensable tool for students, professionals, and anyone in need of quick and reliable calculations. This calculator goes beyond simple arithmetic by offering functionalities such as area and perimeter calculations, volume determinations, unit conversions, solving the Pythagorean theorem, and basic statistical analysis. My inspiration for coding this is how i would struggle with these in high school and how time consuming it was sometimes so this eliminates that problem.

### Key Features:
1. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - The calculator supports evaluation of standard mathematical expressions using basic operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can handle complex expressions with multiple operators and parentheses to ensure correct order of operations.

2. **Area Calculations**:
   - Calculate the area of various geometric shapes including:
     - **Rectangles and Squares**: Using length and width or side length.
     - **Circles**: Utilizing the radius.
     - **Triangles**: Based on base and height.
     - **Parallelograms**: Calculated through base and height.

3. **Perimeter Calculations**:
   - The calculator determines the perimeter of multiple shapes:
     - **Rectangles and Squares**: Using side lengths.
     - **Circles**: Calculated via circumference (using the radius).
     - **Triangles**: Based on the sum of all sides.
     - **Pentagons and Hexagons**: Using side lengths.

4. **Volume Calculations**:
   - Calculate the volume of three-dimensional objects, including:
     - **Cylinders and Cones**: Using radius and height.
     - **Spheres**: Calculated from the radius.
     - **Cuboids and Cubes**: Using length, width, and height (or side length).
     - **Pyramids**: Utilizing base area and height.

5. **Unit Conversions**:
   - Convert between different units of measurement, covering categories such as:
     - **Length**: Meters, kilometers, inches, feet, miles, etc.
     - **Area**: Square meters, acres, hectares, etc.
     - **Volume**: Liters, cubic meters, gallons, etc.
     - **Weight**: Grams, kilograms, pounds, etc.
     - **Temperature**: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin.
     - **Speed**: Meters per second, kilometers per hour, miles per hour.
     - **Time**: Seconds, minutes, hours, days.
     - **Digital Storage**: Bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes.

6. **Pythagorean Theorem**:
   - Solve for any missing side of a right triangle by applying the Pythagorean theorem (\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\)), where you can input two sides and get the third.

7. **Statistics Calculations**:
   - Perform basic statistical analysis on a dataset by computing:
     - **Mean**: The average of the data set.
     - **Median**: The middle value when the data set is sorted.
     - **Mode**: The most frequent value in the data set.

8. **History View**:
   - The calculator keeps track of all calculations performed during the session, allowing users to review their previous calculations. This feature is particularly useful for keeping a record of complex operations without needing to re-enter data.

### How to Run

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and change to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd path_to_project_directory
     ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the main Python script to start the calculator:
     ```bash
     python project.py
     ```

4. **Using the Calculator**:
   - The application will display a text-based menu with options for various calculations. Follow the prompts to choose an operation and enter the required inputs.
   - The calculator will display results directly in the terminal or command prompt.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how the application operates:

- **Arithmetic Operations**:
  - Choose the option for arithmetic operations and enter an expression like `3 + 5 * 2`.
- **Area Calculations**:
  - Select the area calculations option and specify the shape (e.g., `circle`). Input the required parameters such as radius.
- **Perimeter Calculations**:
  - For perimeter calculations, choose the shape and input the necessary dimensions (e.g., sides of a rectangle).
- **Volume Calculations**:
  - Select the volume calculation option and provide dimensions for shapes like cylinders or cubes.
- **Unit Conversions**:
  - Choose the type of conversion and input values along with the units (e.g., converting from meters to kilometers).
- **Pythagorean Theorem**:
  - Input the known sides or hypotenuse to solve for the unknown side of a right triangle.
- **Statistics Calculations**:
  - Enter a list of numbers to compute mean, median, and mode.

### Notes
- Ensure all input values are correctly formatted and within expected ranges.
- If you encounter any issues or errors, verify that you are using Python 3.x and that all code files are in the correct directory.


Overall, the Advanced Calculator is a robust, feature-rich tool that caters to diverse computational needs in a user-friendly manner.
